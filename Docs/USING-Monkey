  Usage Instructions for Monkey NetSurf                            13 March 2011
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This document provides usage instructions for the Monkey version of 
  NetSurf.

  Monkey NetSurf has been tested on Ubuntu.

Overview
========

  What it is
  ----------

  The NetSurf Monkey front end is a developer debug tool used to
  test how the core interacts with the user interface.  It allows
  the developers to profile NetSurf and to interact with the core
  directly as though the developer were a front end.
 
  What it is not
  --------------

  Monkey is not a tool for building web-crawling robots or indeed
  anything other than a debug tool for the NetSurf developers.

  How to interact with nsmonkey
  -----------------------------

  In brief, monkey will produce tagged output on stdout and expect
  commands on stdin.  Windows are numbered and for the most part
  tokens are space separated.  In some cases (e.g. title or status)
  the final element on the output line is a string which might have
  spaces embedded within it.  As such, output from nsmonkey should be
  parsed a token at a time, so that when such a string is encountered,
  the parser can stop splitting and return the rest.

  Top level tags for nsmonkey

    %bool% will be TRUE or FALSE
    %str% is a string and will only ever be at the end of an output line.

  Warnings, errors etc

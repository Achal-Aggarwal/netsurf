  Build Instructions for AmigaOS NetSurf                       10 January 2009
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This document provides instructions for building the AmigaOS version of
  NetSurf and provides guidance on obtaining NetSurf's build dependencies.

  AmigaOS NetSurf has been tested on AmigaOS 4.0 July 2007 Update and AmigaOS
  4.1.  It will require modification for AmigaOS 3.9 or earlier, or other
  Amiga-like platforms.

  AmigaOS NetSurf will build against newlib by default, building against
  clib2 has not been tested.


  Building and executing NetSurf
=================================

  First of all, you should examine the contents of Makefile.config and enable
  and disable relevant features as you see fit.  Some of these options can be
  automatically detected and used, although it is better to explicitly enable
  or disable options.
  
  You should then obtain NetSurf's dependencies, keeping in mind which options
  you have enabled in the configuration file.  See the next section for
  specifics.
  
  Once done, to build AmigaOS NetSurf on OS4, simply run:

      1> gmake

  If that produces errors, you probably don't have some of NetSurf's build
  dependencies installed. See "Obtaining NetSurf's dependencies" below, or turn
  off the complaining features in Makefile.config.

  Running NetSurf from the build tree requires some setup:

      1> makelink resources amiga/resources force
      1> makelink NetSurf.info amiga/dist/NetSurf.info

  It should then be possible to run NetSurf by executing NetSurf from the
  Shell or by double-clicking on the icon.


  Obtaining NetSurf's build dependencies
========================================

  Many of NetSurf's dependencies are included with the OS4 SDK or available
  from Aminet or OS4Depot.  The remainder must be built manually.


  Lemon
-------

  A pre-built version of Lemon is available from Aminet:
      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/c/lemon


  RE2C
------

  A pre-built version of re2c is available from Aminet:
      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/c/re2c


  cURL
------

  A version of libcurl built for newlib is available from Aminet
      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/lib/libcurl


  libmng
--------

  NetSurf uses libMNG to display MNG and PNG files.
  It builds without any problems on OS4, or an older version is available
  from Aminet:
      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/lib/libmng


  libxml2
---------

  libxml2 is available from Aminet:

      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/lib/libxml2


  OpenSSL
----------

  NetSurf uses OpenSSL for encrypted transfers.  The archive on Aminet/OS4Depot
  is missing the newlib version of the library.


  Libnsbmp
----------

  NetSurf has its own library for decoding and rendering BMPs, ICOs, etc.
  You can check it out from svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libnsbmp
  
  To build:
  
      1> gmake


  Libnsgif
----------

  NetSurf has its own library for decoding and rendering GIFs.  You can check
  it out from svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libnsgif
  
  To build:

      1> gmake


  Hubbub
--------

  NetSurf can use Hubbub, the project's HTML parser, instead of using libxml2's
  HTML parser.  To build this, you will also require libparserutils.  Firstly,
  check out libparserutils from;
  
      svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libparserutils
  
  and do the usual "gmake".  Once this is built and installed, you
  can check out and build Hubbub.  Check out hubbub from;
  
      svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/hubbub

  and again do the usual "gmake".


  Librosprite
-------------

  NetSurf uses James Shaw's librosprite for rendering RISC OS Sprite files on
  non-RISC OS platforms.  The Makefile will automatically use librosprite, you
  can disable it by editing Makefile.config.

  To build librosprite, check out from svn://svn.rjek.com/jshaw/libsprite/trunk

      1> gmake


  Libhpdf
---------

  NetSurf can use Haru PDF to enable PDF export and printing in GTK.  This
  is currently enabled by default, and cannot be auto-detected by the Makefile.
  If you wish to disable it, do so by editing Makefile.config.

  Haru PDF can be obtained from http://libharu.sourceforge.net/, although we
  currently depend on features that the official version does not have.  You
  can obtain our patched version from the following Subversion address until
  the patches are accepted upstream;

      svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libhpdf


  libregex
----------

  A version of the regular expression library can be obtained from Aminet:

      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/lib/libregex-4.4.3


  libsvgtiny
------------

  Enabling SVG support requires libsvgtiny, which can be obtained from SVN:

      svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libsvgtiny

  Building libsvgtiny requires gperf available from Aminet:

      http://www.aminet.net/package/dev/c/gperf


  openurl.library
-----------------

  The AmigaOS mailto: URL support uses openurl.library, this and the includes
  can be obtained from Aminet:

      http://www.aminet.net/package/comm/www/OpenURL-OS4


  General requirements
----------------------

  SDK:newlib/include/strings.h needs to be modified by adding the following:

      extern int strcasecmp(const char *, const char *);

  amiga/version.c is generated by version.rexx using the SVN command.  If
  the source has not been checked out from SVN, or is being cross-compiled,
  this file will need to be created by hand.  See the end of version.rexx
  for the variables that are defined in the file.

  Please note that building with Cairo (option NETSURF_AMIGA_USE_CAIRO) will
  link NetSurf against shared objects, and require the OS4.1 SDK to build and
  AmigaOS 4.1 to run.

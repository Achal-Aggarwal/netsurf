  Build Instructions for Framebuffer NetSurf                    12 February 2009
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This document provides instructions for building the Framebuffer version of 
  NetSurf and provides guidance on obtaining NetSurf's build dependencies.

  Framebuffer NetSurf has been tested on Ubuntu and Debian.

  Building and executing NetSurf
=================================

  First of all, you should examine the contents of Makefile.config and
  enable and disable relevant features as you see fit in a
  Makefile.config.override .  Some of these options can be
  automatically detected and used, and where this is the case they are
  set to such.  Others cannot be automatically detected from the
  Makefile, so you will either need to install the dependencies, or
  set them to NO.
  
  One option it is vitally important to set is the Framebuffer ports
  frontend type by setting the NETSURF_FB_FRONTEND variable. The port
  can run on a number of simple framebuffer implementations including
  the linux framebuffer and an SDL surface.

  You should then obtain NetSurf's dependencies, keeping in mind which options
  you have enabled in the configuration file.  See the next section for
  specifics.
  
  Once done, to build Framebuffer NetSurf on a UNIX-like platform, simply run:

      $ make TARGET=framebuffer

  If that produces errors, you probably don't have some of NetSurf's build
  dependencies installed. See "Obtaining NetSurf's dependencies" below. Or turn
  off the complaining features in Makefile.config. You may need to "make clean"
  before attempting to build after installing the dependencies.

  Run NetSurf by executing the "nsfb" shell script:

      $ ./nsfb

  This script makes it easy to run the nsfb binary from the build tree. It
  sets up some environment variables which enable NetSurf to find its
  resources.

  Selecting a frontend and appropriate options  
==============================================  

  The framebuffer port can operate on a number of frontends. A
  frontend in this context is simply the combination of input and
  output devices. A frontend output device may be any linearly mapped
  area of memory. The framebuffer may be treated as values at 32, 16
  or 8 bits per pixel. The input device is typically selected to
  complement the output device and is completely specific to the
  frontend.

  There are several configuration options which may influence the
  framebuffer frontends. These are:

    fb_refresh - The refresh rate (for physical displays)
    fb_depth - The depth (in bits per pixel) of the framebuffer
    window_width - The width of the framebuffer
    window_height - The height of the framebuffer

  The defaults are for 800 by 600 pixels at 16bpp and 70Hz refresh rate.

  There are currently four frontends:

    linux Output to a Linux framebuffer and input from linux input
          event device nodes. The output device is specified with
          the fb_device option which defaults to /dev/fb0 . The
          input nodes are searched for in the path specified by the
          fb_input_devpath option which defaults to /dev/input/

    sdl   The SDL frontend is a straightforward port to the SDL library
          which abstracts the input and output from the application and has
          been targeted to several operating systems.

    vnc   The VNC server frontend uses the libvncserver library to
          provide a straightforward unsecured VNC server, multiple
          clients may connect.

    able  Output to the Simtec ABLE bootloader framebuffer and input
          from its input device node.

  Obtaining NetSurf's build dependencies
========================================

  Many of NetSurf's dependencies are packaged on various operating systems.
  The remainder must be installed manually.  Currently, some of the libraries
  developed as part of the NetSurf project have not had official releases.
  Hopefully they will soon be released with downloadable tarballs and packaged
  in common distros.  For now, you'll have to make do with svn checkouts.


  Package installation
----------------------

  Debian-like OS:

      $ apt-get install libglade2-dev libcurl3-dev libxml2-dev libmng-dev 
      $ apt-get install librsvg2-dev lemon re2c

  Recent OS versions might need libcurl4-dev instead of libcurl3-dev but
  note that when it has not been built with OpenSSL, the SSL_CTX is not
  available and results that certification details won't be presented in case
  they are invalid.  But as this is currently unimplemented in the Framebuffer
  flavour of NetSurf, this won't make a difference at all.

  Fedora:

      $ yum install libglade2-devel curl-devel libxml2-devel libmng-devel
      $ yum install librsvg2-devel lcms-devel re2c

  Other:

  You'll need to install re2c, a tool which builds the CSS lexer, and the
  development resources for libglade2, libcurl3, libxml2, libmng and librsvg.

  Note that if you don't require MNG or JNG image support, NetSurf can be
  configured to use libpng instead of libmng. If you wish to do this, install
  the libpng development package instead.

  Libnsbmp
----------

  NetSurf has its own library for decoding and rendering BMPs, ICOs, etc.
  You can check it out from svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libnsbmp
  
  To build and install it:
  
      $ sudo make install

  Libnsgif
----------

  NetSurf has its own library for decoding and rendering GIFs.  You can check
  it out from svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libnsgif
  
  To build and install it:

      $ sudo make install

  Hubbub
--------

  NetSurf can use Hubbub, the project's HTML parser, instead of using libxml2's
  HTML parser.  To build this, you will also require libparserutils.  Firstly,
  check out libparserutils from;
  
      svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libparserutils
  
  and do the usual "sudo make install".  Once this is built and installed, you
  can check out and build Hubbub.  Check out hubbub from;
  
      svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/hubbub

  and again do the usual "sudo make install".

  Librosprite
-------------

  NetSurf uses James Shaw's librosprite for rendering RISC OS Sprite files on
  non-RISC OS platforms.  The Makefile will automatically use librosprite if
  it is installed.  You can disable it entirely by editing Makefile.config.

  To build librosprite, check out from svn://svn.rjek.com/jshaw/libsprite/trunk
  Build and install it:

      $ sudo make install

  Optionally, specify an install prefix:

      $ PREFIX=/path/to/install make install

  Libhpdf
---------

  NetSurf can use Haru PDF to enable PDF export and printing in GTK.  This
  is currently enabled by default, and cannot be auto-detected by the Makefile.
  If you wish to disable it, do so by editing Makefile.config.

  Haru PDF can be obtained from http://libharu.org/, although we currently
  depend on features that none of the official released versions does have.
  The current development versions of libharu are fine and we anticipate
  the libharu 2.2 release will be fine for NetSurf usage.
  A recently taken snapshot of one of those libharu development versions can
  be found at:

      svn://svn.netsurf-browser.org/trunk/libharu

  Lemon
-------

  If your distribution does not package 'lemon' (Fedora doesn't) then you'll
  need to download it and build it yourself. You may find it comes with the
  SQLite packages (SQLite's parser is built with lemon). If not, try this:

      $ mkdir -p /usr/local/share/lemon
      $ wget http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/getfile/sqlite/tool/lemon.c
      $ wget -O /usr/local/share/lemon/lempar.c http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/getfile/sqlite/tool/lempar.c
      $ sed -e's!lempar.c!/usr/local/share/lemon/lempar.c!' lemon.c > lem.c
      $ gcc -o /usr/local/bin/lemon lem.c


  General requirements
----------------------

  Depending on the frontend selected the build may need specific
  libraries installed, e.g. the SDL port requires SDL1.2 or later

  Installing these libraries will often will pull in loads of things,
  like the PNG and JPEG libraries, colour management libraries, zlib,
  OpenSSL etc that NetSurf also depends on.

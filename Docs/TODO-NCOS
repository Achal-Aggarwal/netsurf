TODO-General for NCNetSurf.

This file documents general things which need doing.


Tidy up 'kiosk' theme support (right now it's a bodge!)
Tidy up templates to give better layout on widescreen displays
Finish keyboard based page navigation support (this will also be available for vanilla NetSurf)
Unset unsued, and claim used NCFresco & NCBrowse system variables
Make compatible with default NC applications such as !Sennen & NCConfig (This will be semicomplete when the NCFresco & NCBrowse system variables are claimed!)
Create fancy HTML based pages for the following:

	* Welcome
	* Help
	* About / Credits
	* SmartCard Info/Action (not required but Acorn's look awful!)

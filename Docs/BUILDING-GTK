To build the GTK version of NetSurf on a UNIX-like platform (although it has
only been tested on Debian, Ubuntu and FreeBSD), simply run "make gtk" once
you have got the relevent build dependancies installed.  Under a Debian-like
OS, this should suffice:

	apt-get install libglade2-dev libcurl3-dev libxml2-dev lemon re2c

This will pull in loads of things, like all the GTK dev libraries, the PNG and
JPEG libraries, colour management libraries, zlib, OpenSSL etc that NetSurf
also depends on.

lemon and re2c are the parser and lexer generators used to create NetSurf's CSS
support.  If you have trouble finding lemon for your platform, it forms part of
the SQLite distribution, and consists of a single C file and a single runtime
data file, and is trivial to build yourself.

Type "make gtk".  Currently, this produces a huge number of warnings, mostly
due to confused signedness.  These havn't been fixed yet but are mostly
harmless.

Once you've built NetSurf, you should have an executable called nsgtk.  You
can't run this directly without setting up some environment variables so that
NetSurf can find its resources (such as the window definitions, text resources,
etc).  A small shell script called "netsurf" is provided to make it easy to run
NetSurf from the build tree.

Memory management
=================

This section describes memory management. See Error handling for how memory
exhaustion is handled.

Finding leaks on RISC OS
------------------------
Memory allocation can be traced and leaks can be found using dmalloc.

Install dmalloc from the riscos.info autobuilder. Set the environment variable
TLINK_MEMCHECK=dmalloc and re-link !RunImage.

On RISC OS,

  *Set DMALLOC_OPTIONS debug=0x2,log=dmalloc_log

set the working directory to a RAM disc, and run NetSurf. When it quits,
dmalloc_log will contain a list of unfreed blocks.

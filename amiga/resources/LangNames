# LangNames file for NetSurf AmigaOS
# 
# Maps AmigaOS locale.library language names to the two character
# RISC OS equivalents, enabling localised text strings files
# shareable with the RISC OS version of NetSurf, without the
# hassle of renaming directories.
#
# Format is <Locale language name>:<two character language code>
#
# Netsurf will use the full AmigaOS language name if it is not
# present in this file.  If you add a translation please use the
# RISC OS naming scheme when possible and add it to this file!

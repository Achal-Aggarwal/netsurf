TODO's (no priority order)

 - Optimize drawing of 1px width / height tiled bitmaps (stretch)
 - Optimize remove / redraw of caret, use pixbuffer instead?
 - Optimize drawing of bitmaps on Low-Memory machines
 - Optimize Clipping for Plotters ( use OS clipping instead of own clipping )
 - Restore the Palette when Windows get's the Focus
 - Make drawing of tiled bitmaps optional ( they are slooow )
 - Implement TreeView 
 - Implement TreeView Hotlits
 - Implement TreeView History
 - Implement TreeView SSL Dialog
 - Implement Native Select Menu
 - Implement Frames (?)
 - Implement IFrames
 - Implement offscreen plotter
 - Implement Options Dialog
 - Implement Favicon Display
 - Optimize behaviour when windows gets the newtop,
   set focus to the frame where the click occured, 
   not just the frame container.
 - Replace RSC strings with string from messages file. 
 - Implement Selection within URL Widget by depressing SHIFT + Mouse Click
 - Implement Home / End Cursors within the URL Widget
 - Test pages that use a refferer.
 - Optimize Offscreen Plotter: Save inactive framebuffers to disk?
 - Ensure that a font-face is set to the default font when it couldn't be loaded.
 - Loose focus for browser / url widget etc. when changing focus 
   ( at best, implement callback for this...)
 - Yahoo.de / .com etc. still crashes - this is probably not an Atari-Version
   fault, but applies to all other netsurf versions. 
 - Have browser_window specific cursor, window specifc cursor 
 - At some places I query for gdos version and use v_gtext when running 
   classic TOS. This is maybe not really correct, altough the v_ftext work
   on the newer OS (MiNT) it doesn't mean I'm using it correct. 
 - When minimized (not iconyfied) NetSurf doesn't recognize that.
 - Iconify Code kompletieren ( favicon, icon nach oben schieben - icon name anzeigen)
 - fix ablend() function within vdi plotter, antialiased text only looks good when rendered 
   on white / black backgrounds, maybe other colors, but red looks ugly.

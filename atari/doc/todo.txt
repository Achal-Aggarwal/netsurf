TODO's (no priority order)

 - Optimize remove / redraw of caret, use pixbuffer instead?
 - Optimize drawing of bitmaps on Low-Memory machines
 - Optimize Clipping for Plotters ( use OS clipping instead of own clipping )
   ( partially done, needs improvement? )
 - Restore the Palette when Windows get's the Focus
   -> only needed for <= 256 colors 
 - Make drawing of tiled bitmaps optional ( they are slooow )
   -> already optimized, still needed? 
 - Implement TreeView 
 - Implement TreeView Hotlits
 - Implement TreeView History
 - Implement TreeView SSL Dialog
 - Implement Native Select Menu
 - Implement Frames (?)
 - Implement IFrames
 - Implement offscreen plotter
 - Implement Options Dialog
 - Implement Favicon Display
 - Optimize behaviour when windows gets the newtop,
   set focus to the frame where the click occured, 
   not just the frame container.
 - Replace RSC strings with string from messages file. 
 - Implement Selection within URL Widget by depressing SHIFT + Mouse Click
 - Implement Home / End Cursors within the URL Widget
 - Test pages that use a refferer.
 - Optimize Offscreen Plotter: Save inactive framebuffers to disk?
 - Ensure that a font-face is set to the default font when it couldn't be loaded.
 - Loose focus for browser / url widget etc. when changing focus 
   ( at best, implement callback for this...)
 - Yahoo.de / .com etc. still crashes - this is probably not an Atari-Version
   fault, but applies to all other netsurf versions. 
   -> this is caused by regex stack exhaust within mintlib
 - Have browser_window specific cursor, window specifc cursor 
 - When minimized (not iconyfied) NetSurf doesn't recognize that.
 - complete Iconify (webpage favicon )
 - improve mouse tracking 
 - fix this: 
path2url in: ./res/icons/dir.png
path2url out: file:///./res/icons/dir.png
url2path in: file:///./res/icons/dir.png
 - loesung fuer kompletten tree icons path finden
 - schauen warum download_path nicht verwendet wird.

    <h3>Memory usage</h3>
    <p>NetSurf soon runs out of memory.  This is because the memory claimed for the parsed HTML and box structures is not released when another page is requested.  To get around this drag the <b>Next</b> bar in the <b>Task Manager</b> up to something ridiculous before running <i>NetSurf</i>.  When NetSurf runs out of memory it will quit without warning.</p>
    <h3>Relative links</h3>
    <p>Following a relative link does not work if the current URL does not end with a leafname or a slash. Eg: <a href="http://www.riscos.com">http://www.riscos.com</a> would cause problems whereas <a href="http://www.riscos.com/">http://www.riscos.com/</a> would not.</p>
    <h3>Multiple fetches</h3>
    <p>Multiple fetches (in different windows) don't seem to work yet.</p>
    <center><h1>Possibly fixed bugs</h1></center>
    <p>This version includes new table code that should allow <i>NetSurf</i> to work with pages containing malformed tables.</p>
